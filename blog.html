        Using Relative length units in CSS
    </p>
    <article>
        <p>In absolute size unit the size does not change no matter what it is going to be displayed exactly as we defined it, 200px is always going to be 200px. Unlike absolute unit relative are responsive accordng to their containers. Lets consider 20% as a width of some tag, this 20% is going to vary depending on the parent's width, it takes 20% percent width of its container. This feature makes it responsive. The em unit also works like this, 2em means twice of the parents font size. Note that the parent can be anyting including the main html tag.
            Another example can be the rem unit, which is relative to the html font size. 1rem is equal to 16px. However this can be changed in the browser setting. Zooming it also changes this value.
            In general using relative units is advisible since  there is much difference in screen sizes between different devices.

           HTML default width equals 16px.
        </p>
        <article>
            <p>"What does it mean when we set some element's width to 200px or some value greater the than whole html width which is 16px?" Is the question we all had when working size. However 16px does not define the html width rather it is defining the html font width. So when we set some width to 200px, which is an absolute unit, it has nothing to do with the 16px <b>FONT SIZE</b> of the default width. To make it clear, 16px is the default font size. We use it as reference to make  responsive features(rem unit).   </p>
